    content: `At Clayton Homes, I lead the redevelopment of the VMFHomes website, a public-facing platform for purchasing used and reposed manufactured homes. The project is built in Next.js with TypeScript and utilizes Contentful as the CMS for dynamic content management. I've implemented Open-Next to bundle the application and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy on AWS, creating a fully serverless, scalable solution that reduces hosting costs. Additionally, the site integrates with a .NET Core backend API to retrieve asset information, ensuring accurate, up-to-date listings for users.

I also developed a custom GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, reducing deployment time by 84% and enabling faster, more reliable updates. This project has uplifted the previous site, modernizing the technology stack and enhancing user experience while optimizing operational costs.`,
